Create a real-time voting system where users can vote on a poll and
see the results updated in real-time using only JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS.
HTML: A simple poll interface with buttons to vote and display the
results.
CSS: Styles the poll and results.
JavaScript:
Defines a vote function to update the local votes.
Updates the vote counts in the UI.
Simulates real-time voting by randomly incrementing votes.
Notes:
 Votes object: Keeps track of the current vote counts for each
language. It initializes each language with 0 votes.
 vote function: This function is called when a button is
clicked. It increments the vote count for the selected language
and calls updateVotes to refresh the displayed vote counts.
 updateVotes function: Updates the displayed vote counts by
setting the text content of the spans in the results section to
the current vote counts.
 setInterval: Simulates real-time updates by randomly
incrementing the vote counts every 2 seconds. This mimics
votes coming in from other users in real time.
