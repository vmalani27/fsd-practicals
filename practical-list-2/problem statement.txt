Create a simple weather application that displays a hardcoded
temperature for a given city. This simple weather application
demonstrates basic HTML structure for user input, CSS styling for
layout and appearance, and JavaScript functionality to handle user
interactions and display dynamic content. It provides a foundational
example of building an interactive web application using essential
front-end technologies.
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6)
